# Local Lend

Create a complete business web application called "Cloud Shelf".

Tagline: "It's Your Next Shelf"

Concept:

Cloud Shelf is a hyperlocal personal rental platform where customers can rent items from nearby owners. The system should support location-based visibility, delivery workflow, payment management, and wallet settlements.

Use a modern responsive UI suitable for mobile and desktop.

User Roles:

1. Super Admin

2. Admin

3. Owner

4. Customer

5. Delivery Staff

LOCATION SYSTEM

Create a hierarchical location system:

State

District

Panchayath

Ward

Admin should be able to create Panchayaths and define a Ward Count.

Example:

Panchayath: Kuttanellur

Ward Count: 25

The system must automatically generate Ward 1 to Ward 25.

Create an Area system where Admin can group multiple Panchayaths under a single Area.

Example:

Area: Thrissur East

Panchayaths: Kuttanellur, Ollur, Nadathara, Koorkenchery

When a Panchayath belongs to an Area, all users in that Panchayath automatically belong to that Area.

Delivery charge earnings go to delivery staff wallet when order is completed.
